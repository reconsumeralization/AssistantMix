# System Documentation

This document provides an overview of the advanced AI development ecosystem featuring the Mixtral-8x7B Large Language Model (LLM).

## Overview

The system is designed to provide a robust and customizable AI development environment. It allows for the creation of AI Assistants, management of conversation threads, execution of runs, and much more. The system is highly configurable and extensible, with a focus on transparency and control.

## Components

### AI Model

The AI model used in this system is the Mixtral-8x7B Large Language Model (LLM). It is a pretrained, generative Sparse Mixture of Experts that surpasses most benchmarks. The model can be customized to tailor the AI's characteristics and abilities. For more details, refer to `ai_model.py`.

### AI Assistant

The AI Assistant is a specialized AI entity tailored for specific tasks. It is powered by the Mixtral-8x7B LLM and can be equipped with up to 128 tools for heightened capabilities. For more details, refer to `assistant.py`.

### Thread

### Issue Management

The issue management feature allows users to create, update, and delete issues. It also provides the functionality to list all existing issues and retrieve specific issues based on user-defined criteria. Users can effectively utilize the issue management feature to track and address software bugs, feature requests, and other project-related tasks.

#### Examples

1. Creating a New Issue:
   ```
   issue_manager.create_issue(title, description, assignee)
   ```

2. Updating an Issue:
   ```
   issue_manager.update_issue(issue_id, new_status)
   ```

3. Deleting an Issue:
   ```
   issue_manager.delete_issue(issue_id)
   ```

4. Retrieving All Issues:
   ```
   issues = issue_manager.list_issues()
   ```

5. Retrieving Specific Issues:
   ```
   issue = issue_manager.get_issue(issue_id)
   ```

#### Best Practices

- Regularly review and assess the effectiveness of the issue management features.
- Identify areas for improvement based on user feedback and data analysis.
- Prioritize feature development and optimization efforts based on user needs and impact.

A Thread represents a conversation session, storing messages for future reference. Threads can be created with initial messages to commence a conversation. For more details, refer to `thread.py`.

### Run

A Run signifies the action of an Assistant on a Thread. Runs can be created, monitored, and managed efficiently. For more details, refer to `run.py`.

### Other Components

The system also includes components for authorization (`authorization.py`), open interpreter (`open_interpreter.py`), knowledge retrieval (`knowledge_retrieval.py`), function calling (`function_calling.py`), and code refactoring platform integration (`code_refactoring_platform.py`).

## Configuration

The system is highly configurable, with settings for the AI model, threads, runs, authorization, open interpreter, knowledge retrieval, function calling, code refactoring platform, UI, error handling, logging, and more. For more details, refer to `config.py`.

## Utilities

The system includes a utilities module that houses essential helper functions and common functionalities shared across multiple modules. For more details, refer to `utilities.py`.

## User Interface

If enabled, the system features a user interface for easier interaction. For more details, refer to `ui.py` and `web_interface.py`.

## Error Handling and Logging

## Feedback Mechanism

Users can provide feedback, report bugs, suggest improvements, and provide general feedback through the following channels:
- **Bug Reports:** Users can report bugs by sending an email to bugs@example.com or by creating an issue in the issue tracker.
- **Improvement Suggestions:** Users can suggest improvements by creating an issue in the issue tracker or by sending an email to improvement@example.com.
- **General Feedback:** Users can provide general feedback by emailing feedback@example.com.

The development team will review and address the feedback according to the following process:
1. Bug reports will be reviewed, and if valid, issues will be created in the issue tracker. These issues will then be prioritized and addressed in upcoming releases.
2. Improvement suggestions will be tracked, reviewed, and considered for future enhancements.
3. General feedback will be reviewed, and constructive feedback will be used to inform improvements to the system.

We value your feedback and strive to continuously improve the system based on user input. Thank you for contributing to the development of our AI ecosystem.

The system includes robust error handling and logging mechanisms. For more details, refer to `error_handler.py` and `logger.py`.

## Dependencies

The system's external dependencies are documented in `requirements.txt`.

## Testing

The system includes test cases for the AI model and the Assistant. For more details, refer to `test_ai_model.py` and `test_assistant.py`.

## Recurring Issue Management
This section documents the new features for managing recurring issues.

### Functionality
The recurring issue management system allows users to create and manage recurring Sweep issues. It provides options for setting up repeat schedules for specific issues or groups of issues and customizing recurrence patterns and notification settings. The system is highly customizable and configurable to suit individual preferences.

### Configuration and Usage
To configure the recurring issue management system, modify the settings in the `recurring_issues` section of the `sweep.yml` file. This section allows users to define repeat schedules, specify recurrence patterns, and configure notification settings. For instructions on how to use the recurring issue management system, refer to the system documentation provided in the `sweep.yml` file.
