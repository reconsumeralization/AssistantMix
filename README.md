# Advanced AI Development Ecosystem

Welcome to our advanced AI development ecosystem, featuring the formidable Mixtral-8x7B Large Language Model (LLM). This pretrained, generative Sparse Mixture of Experts surpasses Llama 2 70B across most benchmarks, highlighting its exceptional capabilities.

## Key Features

- AI Model Customization
- Tool Access
- Persistent Conversations
- File Support
- Issue Management

## Issue Management Features

Issue management features allow users to create, update, and delete issues. It also provides the functionality to list all existing issues and retrieve specific issues based on user-defined criteria. Users can effectively utilize the issue management feature to track and address software bugs, feature requests, and other project-related tasks.
- API Extensibility

## Primary Components

- AI Assistant
- Thread
- Message
- Run
- Run Step

## Getting Started

### Configuring and Using the Recurring Issue Management System
To configure the recurring issue management system, modify the settings in the `recurring_issues` section of the `sweep.yml` file. This section allows users to define repeat schedules, specify recurrence patterns, and configure notification settings. For detailed instructions on setting up, customizing, and using the recurring issue management system, refer to the system documentation provided in the `sweep.yml` file.

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reconsumeralization/AssistantMix/advanced-ai-development-ecosystem.git
cd advanced-ai-development-ecosystem
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

The project configuration can be found in the `config.py` file. Here you can set the AI model name, the number of tools, thread context window, run status check interval, authorization method, and other settings.

```python
# config.py

# AI Model Configuration
AI_MODEL_NAME = 'Mixtral-8x7B'
AI_MODEL_TOOLS = 128

# Thread Configuration
THREAD_CONTEXT_WINDOW = 2048

# Run Configuration
RUN_STATUS_CHECK_INTERVAL = 60  # in seconds

# Authorization Configuration
AUTHORIZATION_METHOD = 'API_KEY'

# Open Interpreter Configuration
OPEN_INTERPRETER_SANDBOXED = True

# Knowledge Retrieval Configuration
KNOWLEDGE_RETRIEVAL_INDEXING = True

# Function Calling Configuration
FUNCTION_CALLING_ENABLED = True

# Code Refactoring Platform Configuration
CODE_REFACTORING_PLATFORM_INTEGRATED = True

# UI Configuration
UI_ENABLED = True

# Error Handling Configuration
ERROR_HANDLING_METHOD = 'LOGGING'

# Logging Configuration
LOGGING_ENABLED = True
LOGGING_LEVEL = 'INFO'  # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
```

## Usage

### Contributing to Issue Management Optimization

Contributions to the improvement and optimization of the issue management features are welcome! Please refer to our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on the process for submitting changes related to issue management.

The main components of the project are the AI model, the assistant, and the thread. You can customize the AI model's characteristics, equip the assistant with tools, and initiate threads with initial messages to commence a conversation.

```python
# ai_model.py

class Mixtral8x7B:
    """
    Class representing the Mixtral-8x7B Large Language Model (LLM).
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.name = config.AI_MODEL_NAME
        self.tools = [None] * config.AI_MODEL_TOOLS
        logger.info(f"AI Model {self.name} initialized with {len(self.tools)} tools.")

    def customize(self, characteristics):
        """
        Customize the AI model's characteristics.
        """
        self.characteristics = characteristics
        logger.info(f"AI Model {self.name} customized with characteristics: {characteristics}")
```

```python
# assistant.py

class Assistant:
    """
    Class representing an AI Assistant powered by the Mixtral-8x7B Large Language Model (LLM).
    """
```

```python
# thread.py
```

## Logging

The project uses Python's built-in logging module to record events, track errors, and capture relevant information during execution. The logging configuration can be found in the `config.py` file.

```python
# utilities.py

# Initialize logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(config.LOGGING_LEVEL)

# Create a file handler
handler = logging.FileHandler('ai_development.log')
handler.setLevel(config.LOGGING_LEVEL)

# Create a logging format
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
handler.setFormatter(formatter)

# Add the handlers to the logger
logger.addHandler(handler)
```

## Testing
